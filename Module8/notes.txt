converter output is a function of two disturbances, 
load current/input voltage and the  control input D

typical input voltage variation ~100 Hz 
typical load between 50 and 100% of nominal

typically output voltage +/- ~some percentage/mV

use negative feedback!

Basics of Control:

"Plant" G(s) transfer function
    - the 'thing' we're trying to control

open-loop = input->output, no feedback
closed-loop = feedback

input = x(s), output y(s)
x = K(s)*err

H(s) feedback sensor/filter/etc pass outpu back to input
through comparison to some ref
    err(s) = yref(s) - H(s)y(s)
    (yref - yh)KG = y

    y/yref = KG/(1+HKG)

goal is to make y/yref = 1, so KG = 1 + HKG
    - HKG is "open loop gain" === T(s)

    for large T y/yref ~= 1/H, H is just a gain scaler
